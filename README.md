## Introduction

Video stabilization is a crucial technique in digital forensics and multimedia applications. It enhances video quality by reducing unwanted camera movements. This project focuses on implementing advanced algorithms for stabilization and performing Region of Interest (ROI) pixel analysis. The methods employed are efficient and effective, making them suitable for various applications.

## Features

- **Advanced Stabilization Algorithms**: Implement various algorithms to stabilize shaky videos.
- **ROI Pixel Analysis**: Analyze specific regions in the video for detailed pixel data.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple command-line interface for ease of use.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Clear guidelines for installation and usage.

## Technologies Used

This project leverages a variety of technologies, including:

- **Python**: The primary programming language for development.
- **OpenCV**: A powerful library for computer vision tasks.
- **NumPy**: Used for numerical operations on arrays.
- **Git**: For version control and collaboration.
- **Markdown**: For documentation formatting.
- **HTML**: Basic structure for any web-related outputs.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tooba-Naz/Advanced_Video_Stabilization_and_ROI_Pixel_Analysis.git
   cd Advanced_Video_Stabilization_and_ROI_Pixel_Analysis
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download Releases**:
   Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/Tooba-Naz/Advanced_Video_Stabilization_and_ROI_Pixel_Analysis/releases) section to download the latest version of the project. Execute the downloaded file to start using the application.

## Usage

To run the video stabilization and ROI pixel analysis, use the following command:

```bash
python main.py --input your_video.mp4 --output stabilized_video.mp4 --roi x,y,width,height
```

- `--input`: Path to the input video file.
- `--output`: Path where the stabilized video will be saved.
- `--roi`: Specify the region of interest in the format `x,y,width,height`.
